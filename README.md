# Spread Spectrum Steganography using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)

## Overview

This project implements a spread spectrum steganography technique enhanced with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to embed secret information within digital images. The goal is to maintain high imperceptibility and security while manipulating the embedding strength parameter (alpha value). Evaluation metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Structural Similarity Index (SSI) are used to assess the quality and fidelity of the stego images.

## Features

- Embed secret information within digital images using DWT.
- Adjustable alpha value for embedding strength.
- Evaluation of image quality using PSNR, MSE, and SSI metrics.
- Visualization of results through plots and graphs.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- **PyWavelets**: For applying Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image opening, manipulation, and saving.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting images and graphs.
- **scikit-image**: For calculating evaluation metrics (MSE, SSI).
